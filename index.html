             Hello, I am Amber Ridgeway native of the Metro-East.  
             I am a horrible writer so bear with me. I did not travel when I was younger due to my parents always working. 
             We did go to Disneyland after my Grandfater won a &dollar;100,000 in the lottery. One of my favorite things to do is find out what Gemstone the country is known for take some home.
             The first Country outside of the United states was Manilla Philliphines.

         <h2 id="philippines">Philliphines</h2>
         <p>My husband then boyfriend was going to work in the Philliphines to set up a call center and was going to be there a few months.
            I was able to visit him twice during that time frame. The Philliphines is about thirteen hours ahead causing my husband to work ridiculously long hours.
            I had invited my friend Sarah to join me so at leaset I could do things during the day. We vistied the Taal Volcano, Pagsanjan Falls and Old Manilla. 
            The Philliphines island is mostly surrond by water which is great enivorment to have pearl farms.  Philliphines are an important source for Golden South Sea Pearls and White South Sea pearls

        <p>
             We we traveling with friends for a wedding in Wisconsin and decided to drive fours to get to Canada.  
             On our way we stopped at the Kakabeka Falls in Provinical Park,which had a great waterfall. We were actually able to visit and amethyst mine in Shuniah Canada.
              We did have to wear mosquito repellent because we were warned of Botflies. I was able to take a few pieces of the ruff amethyst home with me.

        <h2 id="australia">Austrlia</h2>
        <p>
             For our honeymoon we went to Austrlia visiting Sydeny and Melborne. We did perfer Sydeny becasue we were able to walk everywhere versus Melobrone
             we had to do a bit of driving.  Austrila is known for it's white opal. It was too far away to drive to an opal mine but we were able to the opal musesum and buy ruff opal. 
             We were also able to watch little penguins come in from Sea, pet kangroos and koalas, and go to safari tour.         </p>

        <H2>Conclusions</H2>
        <p>
            I hope once the world is safe to travel freely I can put a lot more countries under my belt. 
            So the new future holds places like the Smokey Montains or maybe some well-know state parks.
